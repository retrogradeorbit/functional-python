Functional Python Talk Given At Perth Djangonauts Meetup

# Talk Slides
![The Slides](http://retrogradeorbit.github.io/functional-python)

Clojure project to build the slides HTML is in the folder `builder`.

# First Code Section

## Imperative vs Functional

Code is in folder `languages`. To run:

```
cd languages
python imperative.py
python functional.py
```

# Second Code Section

Refactoring Object Oriented Mutatey approach into Functional Approach

## Object oriented code

This is found in folder `derby1`. Run the code with `python main.py`.

## Change the objects to be values

This code is found in folder `derby2`. Run the code with `python main.py`.
There is a version with the main simulation in a reduce call. This is in
the file `python main-reduce.py`

## Remove the objects completely and just use function and values

Didn't have time to move to this next way of coding in the talk. But check
it out to see how far one can go. This code is found in `derby3`. Run this
with `python main.py`
